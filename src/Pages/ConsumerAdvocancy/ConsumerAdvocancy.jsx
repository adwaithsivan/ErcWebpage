                With the enactment of the Electricity Act-2003 there has been
                significant progress in promoting and protecting the interests
                of the electricity consumers.Electricity regulatory Commissions
                have recognized the need to institutionalize consumer advocacy.
                Consumer participation in Electricity Regulatory process is
                necessary and important to ensure transparency and
                accountability of the process .The Actrequires the Electricity
                Regulator to consult consumers on important policy and
                regulatory matters before arriving at any decision.However,due
                to various reasons, public participation has not been effective
                to the desired levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Electricity Act envisages to protect the interests of
                consumers by making it mandatory for licensees to establish
                Consumer Grievance RedressalForums(CGRFs) for redressal of
                grievances of consumers.Consumers whose grievances are not
                settled by the CGRF or aggrieved on the decision of the CGRF can
                approach the Ombudsman appointed by the State Commission.

                The Consumer Advocacy Cell (CAC) under the Kerala State

                regulatory process thereby ensuring consumer participation in
                the Electricity Regulatory Process. CAC is aiming to enlighten

                view to form Consumer Forums at various places across the state
                to interact with the common consumers in their area. These
                Consumer Forums are to be educated in the Regulatory affairs and
                they in-turn can empower the consumers in their area through
                classes and distribution of pamphlets enabling them to respond
                and take part effectively in the regulatory process. The
                response was tremendous. Pamphlets in Malayalam were printed on
                Standards of performance, Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum &
                Electricity Ombudsman, Tips on Energy saving, Fees & charges

                In addition to the formation of CGRFs & Ombudsmanfor redressalof
                grievances of consumers, the Commission is envisaging a lotof
                activities with regard to protection of consumer interests. A
                Consultant (Public Relations & Consumer Advocacy) is engaged on
                contract basis. Publication of a “Newsletter” is envisaged to
                enhance awareness among the public on the activities of the
                Commision and other related issues in the power sector.

                On request from the NattikaUpabhokhtruSamrakshanaSamithi who
                participated in the Consumers’ meet in Kochi, an awareness class
                was conducted at their premises at Nattika on 12/08/2011 by a
                few officers and Consultants from the Commission. Around 100
                participants attended the class. Officers and staff from nearby
                KSEB offices also were present. The real benefits of regulation
                can accrue only when Consumer Forums are able to act as a
                countervailing force on the utilities and the Regulators.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consumer Forums should be able to respond to the challenges of a
                regulatory regime. Given the fact that the industry has all the
                resources at its command to impress upon the regulators,Consumer
                Forums have to muster enough strength to ensure a level playing
                field. Changes are occurring so fast that to catch up with
                required knowledge, expertise and skill to place their views
                effectively before the Regulators,they must search for experts
                and people with specialized knowledge to match that of the
                industry. Consumer participation under a regulatory regime is
                more than filing complaints in the consumer forum and getting
                compensation for a faulty good / belated service. Involvement in
                regulatory process should form part of theagenda.
